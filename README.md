—Making Meaning for Touch: Interactive 3D Printed Painting—
Touch screens are broadly utilized in museums for providing expanded information/experiences to visitors. However, the touch function is usually used as a way for users to easily interact with the digital platform instead of an approach to create meaningful interaction between visitors and artworks. This R&D project incorporates high-res 3D scan/print and interactive universal design to create a multi-sensory interpretation system for visitors to gain insight into an artwork. The system integrates a 3D printed reproduction of an oil painting, a touch frame, multimedia digital content, and audio descriptions. When a sighted or visual impaired user touches the textual surface of the 3D printed paining, s/he not only feels the brush strokes and canvas texture but also hears the audio descriptions of the touched area/object/color. This is the first prototype for briefly showing the concept and function. The audio description is still in progress.
